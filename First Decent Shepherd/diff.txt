No. Sheep = 20
No. Steps = 1000
No. Specimens = 50
No. Randoms = 2
No. Elitists = 2

Sheep spawn = static
Sheep grazing = false

Sight type = normal/15° angle
Logic type = probabilistic
Movement Type = Analog/15° turn

What was changed:
Fitness function

If total movement = 0 
    0
Else
    1 + ((sheepInitial - sheepLeft)*50 + (SheepDistanceFromBarn() - initialDistanceFromBarn) + ShepherdDistanceFromSheep())/TotalShepherdMovement();

All functions in fitness function return from 0 to 50. So that even one sheep barned is better or equal to anything the other functions can produce
TotalShepherdMovement returns a value between 1 and 2. 1 means no movement at all. 2 is maximum movement possible in the given time.
