What was changed:
Shepherds for reproduction selected proportional to their fitness value

Fitness function adapted so that we don't get division by 0
If total movement = 0 
    1
Else
    2 + ((sheepInitial - sheepLeft)*50 + (SheepDistanceFromBarn() - initialDistanceFromBarn) + ShepherdDistanceFromSheep())/TotalShepherdMovement();
